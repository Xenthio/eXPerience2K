# Building from source

## Requirements

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 or later for the build scripts;
- MinGW-w64 i686 GCC/G++ and `objdump.exe` for the configuration application,
  native x86 resource engine, and x86 Explorer module;
- MinGW-w64 x86_64 GCC/G++ and `objdump.exe` for the native XP x64 engine and
  Explorer module; and
- NSIS 3 with `makensis.exe`.

The produced applications are native Win32/Win64 binaries and do not depend on
.NET. The build script sets the PE operating-system and subsystem versions
needed by NT 5.1/5.2 rather than accepting modern toolchain defaults.

## Build

From the repository root:

```powershell
.\scripts\build.ps1 `
  -GccX86Path C:\msys64\mingw32\bin\gcc.exe `
  -GccX64Path C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\gcc.exe `
  -MakeNsisPath "C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS\makensis.exe"
```

If the three tools are already on `PATH`, the corresponding arguments may be
omitted.

Expected outputs:

```text
build/eXPerience2K.exe
build/eXPerience2KCore-x86.exe
build/eXPerience2KCore-x64.exe
build/eXPerience2KExplorerBand32.dll
build/eXPerience2KExplorerBand64.dll
build/eXPerience2KMediaPreview.exe
dist/eXPerience2K-v3.1.1-Setup.exe
```

Both native cores, both Explorer modules, and the x86 legacy-media host are
included. Explorer remains native to each system's architecture. The installer and
configuration application enforce the exact XP Professional x86 SP3/x64 SP2
support boundary.

## Verify

```powershell
.\scripts\verify-release.ps1
.\scripts\test-logon-background.ps1 -GccX86Path C:\msys64\mingw32\bin\gcc.exe
```

Verification checks the expected output names, PE architecture/NT-version
fields, payload counts, branding, icon, wallpaper, sound and Explorer hashes,
feature defaults, strict dual-profile gates, undecorated x86 COM exports, and
the installer version metadata. The logon tests exercise the image converter
and the real logon-state functions against temporary process-isolated registry
roots, not the host's actual appearance settings. These tests do not replace
XP virtual-machine visual checks. The converter links to XP's built-in
`gdiplus.dll`; no extra runtime is distributed.

## GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/build.yml` runs the same build and verification sequence on
Windows. Workflow artifacts are continuous-integration outputs, not official
releases. The official 3.1.1 release asset is the single installer attached to
the GitHub release.

## Reproducibility note

PE/NSIS timestamps and compressor output can prevent byte-for-byte identical
local rebuilds across toolchain versions. Source and payload equivalence are
attested separately from the exact published installer hash. See
[REPRODUCIBILITY.md](REPRODUCIBILITY.md).

## Development theme presets

The normal build also verifies the legacy theme overlay. Run
`scripts/test-theme-presets.ps1` with the same x86 GCC path.
The NSIS installation must contain x86-unicode stubs and plugins; on MSYS2
use `mingw-w64-i686-nsis` and its `mingw32/bin/makensis.exe`.
See [Theme presets](THEME-PRESETS.md) for the XP VM release checklist.
